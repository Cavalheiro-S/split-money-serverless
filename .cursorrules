# Cursor Rules for Split Money Serverless Project

## Commit Message Rules

When generating commit messages, always follow these rules:

1. **Language**: All commit messages MUST be written in English
2. **Format**: Follow Conventional Commits specification
3. **Structure**: Use the format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

### Commit Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries
- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

### Scopes (based on project structure)
- `auth`: Authentication related changes
- `category`: Category management
- `payment`: Payment status management
- `tag`: Tag management
- `transaction`: Transaction management
- `user`: User management
- `config`: Configuration changes
- `deps`: Dependencies updates

### Examples
- `feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication support`
- `fix(transaction): resolve calculation error in split amounts`
- `docs: update API documentation for user endpoints`
- `refactor(category): improve category validation logic`
- `chore(deps): update serverless framework to v3.0`

### Rules for Commit Messages
- Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
- Keep the description under 50 characters
- Capitalize the first letter of the description
- Do not end the description with a period
- Use present tense ("change" not "changed")
- Be specific and descriptive about what was changed

### Breaking Changes
If the commit introduces a breaking change, add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:
```
feat(api): change user authentication flow

BREAKING CHANGE: The user authentication endpoint now requires additional parameters
```

## Code Style Rules
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing project structure and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add proper error handling
- Include JSDoc comments for public functions
